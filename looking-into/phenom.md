yeah this is a nice, simple, basic thing to start with.

my mom tried to teach me something about phenomenology when i was like. fourteen. i have no idea why, i think i used it in a shitty rs essay once. i definitely used it wrong, because i still have no fucking clue what anyone is actually talking about.

abigail thorn discusses phenomenology in her recent [jordan peterson](https://youtu.be/m81q-ZkfBm0) video. i don't get it!!!!!!!!!!!!

i am so scared to even begin to look at a **handbook** of husserl, let alone the primary text.

our philosophy department have a hard-on for stanford encyclopaedia, and whilst i don't completely discount it, (it's good for introductory reading... kinda, and has tons of citations that are useful for further reading) god. trying to fit everything about a topic on one page leads to some very dense writing. it's not the best by any means.

normally when i don't get a topic, my first port of call is youtube. i'll have a look at that in a bit.

i know i've ignored this for fucking ages, but i finally watched a phenomenology video! [tom nicholas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h95vUgnFdbk&t=28s) has been a great video essay resource for me recently, so it was nice to jump back into his content!

i've made some short notes on the video, which i think gave a great, basic explanation to phenomenology, alongside a specific example (dunkirk) to help explain phenomenological approaches to the concept of time.

as far as i understood the video, phenomenology is from a continental philosophical tradition, taking a post-modern & post-structuralist approach to the world. whereas the cartesian approach explains that the world has a 'definite' and singular meaning, with this being interpreted imperfectly through our sense experience (this reminded me immediately of *meditations* where descartes discussed how the senses can deceive us, and give us an incorrect view of a materially objective reality). phenomenology *focuses* on this sense experience, taking things such as emotion and consciousness into context when depicting meaning, saying that meaning only comes into existence when these personal, experiential aspects are accounted for. 

tom took this into the specific context of time, using the example of *dunkirk* to explain such concepts in an approachable way. whilst we have an objective, cartesian concept of time, in the form of hours/minutes etc. this is clearly not the whole story. we often describe time in context of our emotions, such as it 'flying' when we are having fun, or 'dragging on' during periods of boredom. such phrases are not simply linguistic turns of phrase, they are genuine experiences we feel. in a boring lecture, it *feels* like the lecture is going on for eons, and vice versa. thus, according to a phenomenological approach, the *meaning* of time is not just these hours or minutes, but is also inherently our experience of time itself. this immediately links to a concept that i find hugely interesting, that of *queer temporality*. 

whilst this is a fairly basic look into phenomenology, it feels more close to home than i expected. continental traditions have been promoted throughout my childhood, and being both queer & autistic, i feel as though personal experience is inherent to my understanding of the world. i have typically rejected realist views of the world, in favour of a post-modern, anti-realist approach, so phenomenology (at least, at a basic level) feels rather natural to me. i doubt this sense of comfort will continue as i delve into more academic literature, but i'm excited to find out!
