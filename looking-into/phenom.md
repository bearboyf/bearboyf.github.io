yeah this is a nice, simple, basic thing to start with. \
\
my mom tried to teach me something about phenomenology when i was like. fourteen. i have no idea why, i think i used it in a shitty rs essay once. i definitely used it wrong, because i still have no fucking clue what anyone is actually talking about.\
\
abigail thorn discusses phenomenology in her recent [jordan peterson](https://youtu.be/m81q-ZkfBm0) video. i don\'92t get it!!!!!!!!!!!!\

i am so scared to even begin to look at a **handbook** of husserl, let alone the primary text. \
\
our philosophy department have a hard-on for stanford encyclopaedia, and i don\'92t disagree, it\'92s brilliant for introductory reading (i guess\'85) on a topic, and has tons of citations that are great for further reading, but god. trying to fit everything about a topic on one page leads to some very dense writing. it\'92s not the best.\
\
normally when i don\'92t get a topic, my first port of call is youtube. i\'92ll have a look at that in a bit. }
