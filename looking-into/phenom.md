yeah this is a nice, simple, basic thing to start with.

my mom tried to teach me something about phenomenology when i was like. fourteen. i have no idea why, i think i used it in a shitty rs essay once. i definitely used it wrong, because i still have no fucking clue what anyone is actually talking about.

abigail thorn discusses phenomenology in her recent [jordan peterson](https://youtu.be/m81q-ZkfBm0) video. i don't get it!!!!!!!!!!!!

i am so scared to even begin to look at a **handbook** of husserl, let alone the primary text.

our philosophy department have a hard-on for stanford encyclopaedia, and whilst i don't completely discount it, (it's good for introductory reading... kinda, and has tons of citations that are useful for further reading) god. trying to fit everything about a topic on one page leads to some very dense writing. it's not the best by any means.

normally when i don't get a topic, my first port of call is youtube. i'll have a look at that in a bit.
