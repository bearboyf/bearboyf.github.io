# things i am looking into
* * *

full credit to rose for this, her [gpu series](https://blog.krx.sh) has inspired me a lot to do something similar!

there's a lot of stuff i want to look into more, both academic and non-academic, so this area is just to document my exploration into them all. i'll be rambling about the stuff i read, and probably complaining about not *getting* it. enjoy!
