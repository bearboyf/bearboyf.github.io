<p class="p1">i got my first bass when i was fourteen, after getting a spurt of inspiration from watching a ton of fall out boy &amp; my chemical romance videos. i still have that bass, it’s the only one i have (i’m trying to get my parents to get me a sexy fender one for my birthday &amp; christmas, but it’s looking unlikely) but i’ve since upgraded my amp from the teeny-tiny practice one i started with.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">i had lessons for around a year, from my dad’s friend’s son, just before he went to uni. it was fun, and he also helped me a little with piano (although i’ve entirely given up on it now).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>i didn’t get very far though, and gave up on playing after the lessons fell through. i (partially) put this down to exams, but i was definitely lacking motivation, and struggled to break through the initial barrier of starting a new skill.</p>

<p class="p1">i am notoriously bad at approaching *new* things.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
