<p class="p1"><span class="s1"># on stimming, bass guitar, &amp; perseverance</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* * *</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">i got my first bass when i was fourteen, after getting a spurt of inspiration from watching a ton of fall out boy &amp; my chemical romance videos. i still have that bass, it’s the only one i have (i’m trying to get my parents to get me a sexy fender one for my birthday &amp; christmas, but it’s looking unlikely) but i’ve since upgraded my amp from the teeny-tiny practice one i started with.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
i had lessons for around a year, from my dad’s friend’s son, just before he went to uni. it was fun, and he also helped me a little with piano (although i’ve entirely given up on it now).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>i didn’t get very far though, and gave up on playing after the lessons fell through. i (partially) put this down to exams, but i was definitely lacking motivation, and struggled to break through the initial barrier of starting a new skill.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
i am notoriously bad at approaching *new* things. even moreso when it doesn’t naturally come to me. the most notable example is art, or rather, drawing. i am not a dextrous person by any means, and i often feel like my hands do not work how they should. i am, simply put, *bad* at finicky hand movements. this translated a lot into my many attempts to draw, and my external output had no hope of ever catching up with my internal vision. my mother, on the other hand, is a fantastic artist. i remember a pencil drawing she did of two elephants, that was so beautifully detailed, and so hyperrealistic. i had little hope of getting to this level, especially when i had little perseverance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">over the summer, i got bored, and picked up my bass. for the first time in four years. i had never fallen out of love with the bass, despite never playing. basslines are incredibly stimmy to me. the equaliser on spotify is a godsend, and i have the bass boosted so much that often, you can barely make out the lyrics. when i bought a new headset (the [kraken kittys.](https://www.razer.com/gaming-headsets/razer-kraken-kitty/RZ04-02980100-R3M1) i have no shame), i messed around for ages with its equaliser, creating an amazing bass boosted listening of cocteau twins’ (best) album, [*treasure*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gF8fnsyjCoI&amp;list=PLa3HlKFsnLvaaC7mwuInJZfRVcbvg2bXv). focusing on the bass was an ethereal, dissociative experience. i love it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">i started with a mitski song, [*nobody*.](https://youtu.be/qooWnw5rEcI) this was maybe out of my skillset, considering how poor my form was, but i didn’t care, at least on the day. i just wanted to listen to the sound i was making. in retrospect, the sound i was making was *awful*, but i soon watched a few videos on proper form, and made noticeable improvement quite quickly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">i practice daily now. i’m motivated mostly through stimming. i’d love to get to a level where i can jam with others, and be in a band, but i’m content with where i’m at right now. being able to play a solid bassline, along with songs i love, is really therapeutic. some songs that i’m particularly confident with, i zone out whilst playing, and hone in on the lyrics as i listen. a lot of my recent sparks of inspiration have come from midway through a song, particularly mitski’s [*francis forever*.](https://youtu.be/L05DH-MvPeA) the inspiration to make this site came from when i was playing through [*washing machine heart.*](https://youtu.be/3vjkh-acmTE) i don’t know how long i’ll keep up this daily practice, and i don’t mind, which is new for me.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">i struggle with committing to projects a lot. my room is a museum of half-finished projects, barely read books, and old hyperfixations. it’s a paradoxical situation too, as i never want to invest money, or time, into a new project idea, as i know it’ll be thrown away once i stop hyperfixating, but the hyperfixation is so powerful that i can’t help *but* invest everything into it. i now mostly rely on the assumption that someday in the future, i’ll pick it back up, whether it’s a week or a year away. for a long time, and still to this day at points, this way my brain operated caused deep insecurity &amp; self-hatred. i so badly wanted to just *finish* a single project. for once. as with almost everything else about myself, i’m learning to accept it, knowing that no matter how hard i try, i can’t change how my brain works, i can just work with it instead.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">who knows, maybe in a year i’ll pick up the clarinet again!</span></p>
