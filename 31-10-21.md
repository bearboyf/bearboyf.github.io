# on tattoos, the body, & being trans

i got my second tattoo a couple weeks ago. it's a small quote from a poem i adore, *song* (allen ginsberg):

[*the weight of the world is love*](https://allpoetry.com/poem/8495137-Song-by-Allen-Ginsberg)

my first tattoo is a lesser-known piece of keith haring's artistry, [*untitled, 1982*](https://img.kingandmcgaw.com/imagecache/4/3/bmwcm-5.0_fid-880229_fwcm-1.6_ihcm-50.0_iwcm-50.0_lmwcm-5.0_maxdim-1000_mc-ffffff_rmwcm-5.0_si-435811.jpg_tmwcm-5.0.jpg)

i plan to get many more, with variations in their depth of meaning. some are merely just pretty, some hold deep significance to an aspect of who i am as a person. both are equal in my eyes.  
naturally, as a trans person, i have a complicated history with my body. being both fat and autistic has only served to complicate this further, but i don't wish to delve into the basic narrative of individualised self-hatred that i've had to battle throughout a lot of my life. i'm more personally interested in analysing aspects of power, and control, and how tattoos (amongst other bodily modifications, whether temporary or permanent) have become so significant in my navigation of the world.

taking the foucauldian perspective, the body is not an objective reality that can stand as a separate entity from culture and history. the body is dynamic, it changes and shifts with the influence of societal and cultural norms, and as a natural response, our views on the body change with this. the body is also a site for which one can exert a significant level of power, with foucault showing this, and explaining that manipulating the body can manipulate the mind. this historicization of the body has resonated with many queer theorists, myself included. i remember many early instances in which someone attempted to control my body, and all have had a profound effect on me mentally. school uniforms were a specific form of torture for me, and restricted my personal expression of my identity greatly. even after i came out in my senior school, i still wore skirts (until i started sixth form), making me feel like an impostor, a charlatan of my own gender. i was socially expected to present as a man to those who knew *me*, yet i couldn't. i've always found more dysphoria in being forced to participate in 'female' aspects of life when around those i am out to, than when i'm closeted. it makes me become hyper-aware of the fact that despite my peers affirming my name, my pronouns, my identity, my material body has not yet caught up in its social expectation. or rather, normative societal binaries still enforce such penetrative ideals as 'skirts are for girls' that they harm me. navigating trans healthcare isn't much better. whilst the uk has a particularly bad situation currently, with essentially murderous waitlists, that feel like hold call music so grating it physically hurts to listen to, the western medico-scientific establishment on the whole is just as bad. 

the enlightenment era brought about an obsession with categorisation, eventually leading to the taxonomic revolution in the 19th century. institutions enjoy categories. i wouldn't describe it inaccurate to say that institutions are *horny* for neat categorisation. this comes into its prime within the medico-scientific realm, particularly in context of mental health, which is littered with the remnants of cartesian dualist thinking; the dichotomy of physical and mental, the split between sane and insane, and the treatment given to trans people. we are seen as deviating from the hegemonic western binary, even if we consider ourselves to be 'male or 'female'. deviance from such a binary, leads to a pathologisation, and the construction of trans identity as a 'condition' that is in need of 'treatment'. there's a good paper i read earlier today that discusses this in more [depth](https://etd.ohiolink.edu/apexprod/rws_etd/send_file/send?accession=osu1339452660&disposition=inline/). trans people exist in a catch 22, where we need the medical institution for access to hrt, surgery, etc., in order to live happily, but such an institution is built on the pathologisation of a core aspect of who we are. in controlling this 'deviancy', they control access. that's essentially the crux of the uk gic system. they provide enough access, to show that they actually *do* things, but little enough to maintain control. 

this all encompassing control of the body is not exclusive to trans people of course, it's simply how it's affected my life most significantly. physically disabled people have to practically beg, to receive an ounce of accessibility to something as mundane as a shop, or restaurant. women's bodies are a subject of control in immeasurable ways (e.g. abortion discourse is not about the morality of abortion in and of itself, it is an attempt to control the 'female' body). i could continue forever, deconstructing every aspect of any body, and how our identity is inextricably tied to the body, hence why such control affects us so greatly. 

that's where tattoos come in. compare a tattoo to another modification i desire: top surgery. ignoring the barrier of money, there are no barriers to a tattoo for me. i choose what design i want, i find a suitable artist, i get it done. with top surgery, assuming i go down the nhs route, i first have to beg a gp to get a referral to a clinic. next comes the waiting, *ad infinitum*. even after getting gic access, i have to prove to others who i am, that i feel enough anguish about my body, yet not so much anguish that i am mentally unstable. the list of barriers goes on, including bmi, travelling, time off work, etc. 

tattoos are a way for me to reclaim bodily control. i can make myself look how i want. no one stops me. they aren't my only method: i dye my hair (a little too) frequently, i have piercings, and i wear the clothes i like. however tattoos are permanent. like top surgery, tattoos are a permanent change to my body, that come with a list of possible risks and complications, but ultimately serve as affirmation for who i am. tattoos are the closest thing i will get to the euphoria of top surgery for a good few years. tattoos, for me, are an act of gender affirmation, and euphoria. 

i tie my identity, and my gender to many things, my sexuality being a major one. but tattoos are important too. with a tattoo, i can express other facets of identity. i first heard the ginsberg poem from my first boyfriend. *song*, among other ginsberg poems, reconnected me with poetry, something i once again hold deeply in my heart. i look up from where i currently sit, and i have a small collection of poetry, each individual poem serving as an emotive, and deeply personal expression of the poet, whether it's the rejection of assimilation in richard scott's [*oh, my soho*](https://youtu.be/B7oWTubGC1w), or the colourful expression of gayness in whitman's [*we two boys together clinging*](https://www.poetry.com/poem/38239). 

i also revel in the temporality of getting a tattoo. many warn others against tattoos, with a focus on the potential of regret later in life. that doesn't deter me in the slightest. i once desperately wanted to get euler's identity. when i was younger, i wanted a big, colourful gorillaz piece. if i had managed to get these, i wouldn't regret them today. they represent who i *was* at that specific point in time. they could be beautifully nostalgic, or i could want to cover them up, with something more congruent to who i am at present. i like that.

dying my hair was adolescent me's way of coping with crushing dysphoria, and mental illness. tattoos are adult me's way of reclaiming back my body from the institutions that so badly want to deter me from being simply, me. 

the next tattoo i'm getting is the symbol for testosterone, something that has saved my life.
