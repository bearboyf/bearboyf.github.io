# extended info

whilst i am currently studying philosophy & theology, i did my a-levels in religious studies, mathematics, and further mathematics. i have a broad interest in the inter-disciplinary humanities, and still maintain a great (more hobby-like) interest in both mathematics and computer science.  


## academic interests: 
* religious experience, especially mysticism
* the relationship between religion and mathematics
* aesthetics, particularly in a musical or video game context
* philosophy of language interlinked with identity
* disability studies, focused on autistic culture & thought
* queer theory, specifically transgender thought
* applying contemporary queer thought to philosophical concepts
* queer theology, focusing moreso on affirmative rather than defensive approaches
* sexual ethics & theory
* entheogenic studies

of course, i have other interests (for example, decolonising academia and political theory), but these are my main areas of focus!

my more [blog-like](./blog.html) section will include personal thoughts, and discussions of less academic areas of interest. if you're just interested in my scholarly work, [this](./essays.html) is the place for you!

i am inspired mostly by those directly in my life, and by the experiences i have. however, i feel the need to give a special mention to [abigail thorn](https://www.youtube.com/c/thephilosophytube), whose videos have inspired me to bring my thoughts into the public realm.
