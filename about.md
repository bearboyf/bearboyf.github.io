# extended info

whilst i am currently studying philosophy & theology, i did my a-levels in religious studies, mathematics, and further mathematics. i have a broad interest in the inter-disciplinary humanities, and still maintain a great (more hobby-like) interest in both mathematics and computer science.  


## academic interests: 
	* religious experience, especially mysticism
	* the relationship between religion and mathematics
	* aesthetics 
	* philosophy of language interlinked with identity
	* disability studies, focused on autistic culture & thought
	* queer theory, specifically transgender thought
	* applying contemporary queer thought to philosophical concepts
	* queer theology, focusing moreso on affirmative rather than defensive approaches

of course, i have other interests (for example, decolonising academia and political theory), these are my main areas of focus!
